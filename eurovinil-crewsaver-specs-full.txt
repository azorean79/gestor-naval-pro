1.1 GENERAL
1.1.1 This manual is intended for use by the people who will do the regular servicing work on the
equipment. They will normally be employees of the Manufacturer or of Service Stations
appointed by the Manufacturer.
1.1.2 The manual describes the procedures used to disassemble, inspect, repair and reassemble the
equipment. These procedures must be strictly obeyed.
1.1.3 Eurovinil is the Design Authority for the equipment. The company has invested much effort to
create the equipment and its servicing procedures, so that the equipment will be capable of
reliable use, regardless of climate, weather conditions or circumstances.
While comments intended to improve the efficiency of servicing procedures are always welcome,
you must not make any changes to the servicing procedures without the permission of Eurovinil.
Unauthorised changes may cause the equipment to malfunction. They may also void the
approval of the equipment.
1.1.4 This manual covers the Eurovinil ISO and Leisure family of liferafts.
1.1.5 Items included in the liferaft may be subject to approval by the administration of the country
where the liferaft is intended for use.
1.2 LIFERAFT MODELS AND CONSTRUCTION TECHNIQUE
1.2.1 EUROVINIL liferafts are constructed with high-tenacity polyester fabric coated with a specific
mixture on both sides. This material is weather-proof and resistant to hydrocarbons and to
temperature range. It is also rot-proof, it does not deteriorate with time and does not need any
maintenance apart from normal cleaning with fresh water and detergent. Liferaft buoyancy tubes
and floor are assembled by means of high frequency (HF) electronic welding.
WARNING: TALCUM POWDER, WHICH IS NORMALLY USED FOR GOOD PRESERVATION
OF RUBBER MATERIALS, SHOULD NOT BE USED BY ANY MEANS ON
EUROVINIL LIFERAFTS.
All liferafts EV have rectangular configuration.

starts to work. That value must be comprehended between 0,22 e 0,35 bar.
NOTE: FOR DIFFERENT PRESSURE VALUES, REPLACE THE OVERPRESSURE
VALVE AND REPEAT THE TEST.
(d) After PRV test was completed, and pressure has become stabilized in the buoyancy
tubes, restore pressure if lower than 0.20 bar.
(e) After 60 minutes verify that the pressure lost is not more than 5% of the initial
pressure, considering correction values above mentioned.
NOTE: FOR PRESSURE VALUES LOWER THAN WHAT INDICATED, CHECK THE
CAUSE OF THE LOSS AND SEND LIFERAFT TO REPAIR. AFTER REPAIRED,
REPEAT THE TEST.
(f) During test, verify tightness of the inflation valves, overpressure valves and non-
return valves on the lower buoyancy tube, upper buoyancy tube and canopy arch, by
means of soapy water.
(g) In case of air leakage proceed to eliminate the inconvenience (tighten the valve,
replace the gasket, replace the valve body or the ferrule, repair the valve hole on the
buoyancy tube, etc.) as described in the following chapters and repeat test.
