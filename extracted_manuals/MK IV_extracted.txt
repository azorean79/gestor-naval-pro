SERVICE MANUAL
1. General
1.1 This service manual is intended for use by the people who will do the regular
servicing work on the equipment. They will normally be employees of the
Manufacturer or of Service Stations appointed by the Manufacturer. The
manual describes the procedures used to disassemble, inspect, repair and
reassemble the equipment. These procedures must be strictly obeyed.
1.2 Survitec Group Limited is the Design Authority for the equipment. The company
has invested much effort to create the equipment and its servicing procedures,
so that the equipment will be capable of reliable use, regardless of climate,
weather conditions or circumstances.
While comments intended to improve the efficiency of servicing procedures are
always welcome, you must not make any changes to the servicing procedures
without the permission of Survitec Group Limited. Unauthorised changes may
cause the equipment to malfunction. They may also void the approval of the
equipment.
1.3 This manual covers the Marine MK IV family including:
• Elliot
• EV Silver Series
• Crewsaver
• DSB LR07
• Beaufort Seafarer
• New Wave Guardian
• Oceanmaster
• RFD - Surviva
• Survitec Zodiac
1.4 Wheelmark instruction - European Council Directive 96/98/EC
(Marine Equipment) mark of conformity, is known as the ‘Wheelmark’.
An inflatable liferaft which bears the Wheelmark, embodies wheel-marked
components (pyrotechnics, thermal protection aid (TPA’s), position indicating
lamps, retro-reflective tape and HRU). Items not wheel-marked may be subject
to approval by the National authority.

1. Description and Data
1.1 The Marine MK IV range of Throwover board (TO) liferafts are high capacity
liferafts rated for 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20 or 25 persons.
Refer to FIGURE 101A and B.
The range is complemented by Davit-launch (DL) versions sized 12, 16, 20 or
25 persons. Refer to FIGURE 102.
1.2 The design consists of two buoyancy tubes forming a high freeboard, an
insulated floor and an automatically erected canopy for all-weather protection
that incorporates doors, vents and rainwater catchment systems. The canopy is
double skinned for insulation purposes and is supported by an arch tube which
is inflated via the upper buoyancy tube.
1.3 Polychloroprene adhesive (BOSTIK 486) must be used for service repairs.
NOTE: An alternative adhesive, for repair on marine liferafts is
available. This adhesive is called Alpha S5001.
The Alpha S5001 repair adhesive is to be mixed and
used in exactly the same way as the current Bostik
486 adhesive as detailed in the service manuals. This
adhesive can only be purchased from Survitec Group
under the existing P/N 04929009.
1.4 The liferaft is made from the following parts.
Refer to FIGURE 101A and B or FIGURE 102:
1.4.1 Two buoyancy tubes: one installed on top of the other with a floor
suspended below them. This gives a high freeboard.
1.4.2 A canopy, which is erected automatically by an inflated arch tube.
1.4.3 Water pockets, which are installed on the base, make the liferaft stable
and control the drift subsequent to the launch.
1.4.4 The liferaft is made either from rubber-proofed nylon fabric or
polyurethene (PU)-proofed nylon fabric. The buoyancy tubes of the
liferaft are black and the canopy is a high visibility colour.

7. Installation notes:
ONLY USE GENUINE SURVITEC GROUP PARTS FOR INSTALLATIONS.
7.1 When more detailed instructions are necessary, refer to Survitec Group
Customer Service Department.
7.1.1 Stowage positions
(a) Stow the liferafts in a position which will make sure they will
be serviceable when necessary. Make sure they can be easily
launched (manually) or can float-free from a sinking ship.
NOTE: The liferafts must be stowed away from the propellers,
side thrust apertures and stabilisers. The stow position
must not prevent the operation of a survival craft or rescue
boat at any other launching station.
In cases where Davit-launch liferafts are to be fitted they should be
positioned at least 9 m (29.5 ft) forward of the ships propellers.
7.1.2 Protection of stowed liferafts
(a) Stow the liferafts in a position which will give the maximum
possible protection from fire, smoke, vibration, funnel deposits,
sparks, oil, heat, explosion, flooding and weather.
(b) In conditions when ice is present, stow the liferafts in protected
positions (adjacent to casings) so that they will not be frozen over.
(c) Do not stow the liferafts in a positions where they can be in a pool
of water.
(d) Do not let the liferafts touch any material that has copper or
copper compounds.
(e) When using a power hose to wash the ship’s deck and liferaft
installation, do not point the hose directly at the liferaft container.

PÁGINA 76
============================================================
MARINE MKIV
SERVICE MANUAL
7.1.3 Magnetic deviation
(a) In deciding on the stowage position of the liferafts, particularly
in small vessels, consid eration should be given to the possible
effect on the ship’s compass of any ferrous metal in the liferaft or
its stowage arrangements. Under these conditions, liferafts and
their stowage should, if necessary, be regarded as fixed magnetic
material.
7.1.4 Secure the painters
(a) The end of the painter on every liferaft should be secured to a
suitable strong point, so that on being launched the liferaft is
held to the vessel. The securing arrangement for the painter will
normally include a float free arrangement, such as a hydrostatic
release unit, (HRU). Where a HRU is fitted the painter line should
be attached only to the HRU weak link.
WARNING: IT SHOULD BE IMPRESSED UPON ALL MEMBERS OF THE
CREW THAT, IF FOR ANY REASON A LIFERAFT PAINTER HAS
TO BE UNFASTENED BEFORE A LIFERAFT IS LAUNCHED, THEN
IT SHOULD BE MADE FAST AGAIN TO SOME OTHER SUITABLE
STRONG POINT BEFORE LAUNCHING TAKES PLACE.
7.1.5 Height of stowage above the waterline
(a) The liferafts should be stowed as close to the waterline as is safe
and practical.
NOTE: The painter line of the liferaft is at minimum 10 metres
more than the installation height as listed on the exterior of
the container.
(b) Make sure the liferaft is approved to be dropped from the height of
its stowage point.
7.1.6 Installation and removal of liferafts
(a) Be very careful when installing or removing the liferafts at their
stowage positions. The glass-reinforced plastic (the container) can
be damaged and subsequently, the liferaft. They must not be rolled
or dropped during removal/installation.

SERVICE MANUAL
7.1.7 Stowage of liferafts in rigid containers
NOTE: Liferafts are usually packed in rigid containers with no
other protection.
(a) Install the container the correct way up with the drainage apertures
at the bottom. Keep the drainage apertures clear of obstructions
such as the launching cradle support structure.
NOTE: Each cradle must be of the correct dimensions for the type
of container installed. The rack must be attached to the
ship’s structure.
7.1.8 Attachment of stowed liferafts
(a) Make sure the liferaft can be released easily when a manual
launch is necessary or for float-free operation.
Refer to Step 7.1.10.
(b) Make sure the mechanism which holds the liferaft on the rack can
be removed easily in an emergency:
A slip-link (Senhouse slip) or other release mechanism which can
be operated by a single swift action should be provided.
7.1.9 Ramp stowage
(a) On passenger ships which have a large number of inflatable
liferafts installed, the liferafts must be stowed away from the
lifeboat positions along the ship’s side.
(b) The liferafts should be installed on vertical racks or racks that
slope outboard to the sea. If the liferafts are installed in this way,
make sure each liferaft can be released independently and that
the float-free attachment is satisfactory. Refer to Step 7.1.10.

SERVICE MANUAL
7.1.10 Float-free attachment (hydrostatic release)
(a) A float-free launch is operated by a mechanism which inflates and
releases the liferaft automatically from a ship that is sinking.
NOTE: The hydrostatic release must be installed as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
NOTE: If the hydrostatic release is a type which requires
servicing, it must be serviced by an approved servicing
station. The service station must record the date of
servicing on the data plate attached to the unit.
NOTE: If the hydrostatic release is a type that must be discarded
(lifed item) it must be identified with the date of expiry
and must be replaced by that date. They usually have an
operational life which does not include a servicing period.
(b) A weak-link must be installed in the hydrostatic system to make
sure a liferaft is not pulled under the water by a sinking ship. The
weak-link in the system must have a breaking strength of 1.8 - 2.6
kN (404.66-584.5 lbf) to pull the painter from the liferaft container
and activate its inflation system.
(c) If it is necessary to launch the liferaft manually, make sure the
painter line is attached to a strong point on the ship. The strong
point must be sufficient to support the pull of the painter line to
operate the inflation system.
(d) A slip link, lashed to the holding down straps, should be provided
between the hydrostatic release and the straps. This will enable
manual quick release for the liferaft.

2. Preparation
2.1 Keep the records of all the inflation tests. A recommended format for the test
cards is shown in TABLE 502.
2.2 Keep the liferaft away from draughts and direct sunlight, as change in
temperature affects pressure.
2.3 Keep a solution of hard soap (not detergent), water, and a quantity of clean,
dry, lint free cloths in the area.
2.4 If a buoyancy chamber needs to be tested separately because of a repair, carry
out a WP test, refer to Section 3 of this chapter.
2.5 Calculate the change in the buoyancy tube pressure, caused by any change in
temperature as follows:
2.5.1 Subtract 38 mm WG (0.054 psi / 1.49 inch WG / 4 mb) from the
manometer indication for each degree Celsius increase in temperature.
2.5.2 Add 38 mm WG to the manometer indication for each degree Celsius
decrease in temperature.
NOTE: The test result is not accepted if the temperature changes
by more than 3.5° C.
2.6 Calculate the change in pressure caused by barometric pressure as follows:
2.6.1 Subtract 10.2 mm WG (0.0145 psi / 0.40 inchWG / 1 mb) from the
manometer indication for each millibar decrease in pressure.
2.6.2 Add 10.2 mm WG to the manometer indication for each millibar
increase in pressure.

3. Test procedures
3.1 General
3.1.1 Test each compartment of the liferaft that inflates. Inflate the liferaft to
the working pressure. The separate compartments of the liferaft that are
inflated by the gas inflation system are:
(a) The lower buoyancy tube:
(b) The upper buoyancy chamber and the arch tube, (if no transfer
valve is fitted).
(c) The arch tube, (if transfer valve is fitted).
3.2 Additional test time intervals
3.2.1 Do a GI test on liferafts every 5 years. Refer to step 3.3.
3.2.2 Carry out a NAP test and test the floor seams on any liferaft that is over
ten years old and subsequently at each 12 month service.
NOTE: It may be necessary to carry out the NAP test if the liferaft
has been repaired, see Step 3.4.
3.3 GI test
3.3.1 Unpack the liferaft, see Chapter 2, REMOVAL AND UNPACKING and
put it on the packing table.
3.3.2 Reconnect the gas cylinder and operating head.
3.3.3 Pull the operating head actuator cable to inflate the liferaft.
3.3.4 Make sure the relief valves operate satisfactorily.
3.3.5 Let the liferaft settle for a minimum of 2 hours.
3.3.6 Use a manometer to make sure the gas pressure in each compartment
of the liferaft is at or above working pressure. Record the gas pressure
in each compartment. Record the temperature and barometric pressure.
3.3.7 Leave the pressure in the each compartment for an additional 60
minutes. If the inflation pressure, corrected for temperature and
barometric changes, decreases by more than 5% of the noted pressure,
the liferaft fails this test.
3.3.8 If the pressure decrease is more than 5%, look for leaks and porous
fabric. If possible, repair the liferaft within the limits given, refer to
Chapter 6, REPAIR. Carry out a re-test of the buoyancy tubes again.

3.4 NAP test
3.4.1 Carry out a NAP test as follows: Install the caps on both relief valves.
Refer to FIGURE 505/1.
3.4.2 Inflate the liferaft slowly to twice the working pressure.
WARNING: DO NOT INFLATE THE BUOYANCIES THROUGH THE HOSES.
3.4.3 Let it stand for a minimum of 5 minutes after which there should be no
seam slippage or cracking or other defects.
3.4.4 If the pressure decreases, allowing for temperature or barometric
changes, by more than 5% the liferaft has failed the NAP test. Look for
leaks and porous fabric. If possible, repair the liferaft within the limits
given, refer to Chapter 6, REPAIR. Carry out a re-test of the buoyancy
tubes again.
3.4.5 If the pressure decreases abruptly during the NAP test and there is
audible ‘cracking’ from the liferaft, condemn the liferaft.
3.4.6 Sounds from the liferaft with no drop in pressure may be ignored.
3.4.7 After testing remove both PRV caps together.
3.5 WP test
NOTE: If the liferaft is subjected to the gas inflation test Step 3.3,
it is still necessary to carry out the WP test, provided no
repair work is carried out.
NOTE: The arch tube is mounted on the upper buoyancy
chamber. These will be fully inflated when the upper
buoyancy chamber is tested. Therefore they will be
checked with the upper buoyancy chamber. Each
compartment will be tested over a period of 60 minutes.
3.5.1 For each inflatable compartment defined in this chapter section 3.1,
carry out a WP test as follows. Refer to FIGURE 503:
(a) Install caps on both relief valves.
(b) Inflate the compartments to between values through the inflate
/ deflate valve shown below. Record the temperature and
barometric pressure.
WARNING: DO NOT INFLATE THE BUOYANCIES THROUGH THE HOSES.

Observations
(a) All tests are to be recorded on a sheet similar to sample provided
in Appendix 4.
(b) Carbon dioxide leaking from the cylinder will cause the pink colour
of the test solution to be lost and the test solution will become
clear.
(c) If no colour change is observed there is no leak of gas from the
cylinder.
(d) The control sample must not change colour during the test.
If a colour change takes place, this indicates that the atmosphere
in the test area is contaminated with carbon dioxide and tests
carried out under this control sample are therefore invalidated.
(e) Tests shall be repeated after corrective action has been taken on
the atmosphere, i.e. area ventilated.
NOTE: This method may also be adapted to check CO leakage
2
from the base of cylinders, by taping a suitable sized
plastic bag over the cylinder. Make sure that the welded
seam is inside the bag. The test is then carried out as per
the above method.
3.11.3 Weight testing
Check the cylinder weight. The weight must be the same as that given on the
cylinder data label. The weight recorded on the cylinder data label does not
include the cylinder recoil caps.

2. Adhesive
WARNING: ADHESIVES ARE FLAMMABLE. KEEP WELL AWAY FROM
NAKED FLAMES. USE ONLY IN A WELL VENTILATED
ATMOSPHERE. AVOID CONTACT WITH EYES. AVOID
BREATHING FUMES. USE BARRIER CREAM ON HANDS AND
WASH AFTER USE.
2.1 The adhesive used for repairs to air-holding components and load-bearing
components, is a two part polychloroprene mix to Specification Bostik 486 or
Alpha S 5001.
2.2 Only the adhesive specified in Step 2.1 shall be used for repairs. Although
other unspecified adhesives may apparently bond surfaces together, they
may also have unexpected negative side effects which will eventually cause
premature failure.
2.3 Mixing Instructions for Bostik 486 Adhesive or Alpha S 5001.
CAUTION: THE MIXING PROCEDURE MUST BE FOLLOWED
EXACTLY SO THAT THE CURING AGENT WILL NOT
SEPARATE FROM THE ADHESIVE.
THE MEASURED VOLUME OF THE CURING AGENT
MUST BE POURED INTO THE APPROPRIATE QUANTITY
OF THE ADHESIVE, STIRRING CONSTANTLY, AND FOR A
MINIMUM OF FIFTEEN MINUTES.
AVOID PARTIAL QUANTITY MIXES IF POSSIBLE. THE
ADHESIVE CAN NOT BE STORED READY-MIXED AS IT
BECOMES UNUSABLE AFTER A FEW HOURS.
2.3.1 Bostik 486 or Alpha S 5001. is a two-part adhesive. Part 1 - is the
adhesive, supplied in a can. Part 2 - is the curing agent (Bostikure),
supplied in a bottle.
It is recommended that the constituents must be mixed together in
these total quantities. After a bottle of curing agent has been opened,
moisture will enter and the curing agent will soon deteriorate if it is not
used.
NOTE: The ratio is 1 litre of adhesive to 40 ml of curing agent.
Chapter 6 M269–00 Page 605

============================================================
PÁGINA 148
============================================================
MARINE MKIV
SERVICE MANUAL
2.3.2 Partial amounts of the mixture may be made up but, after the curing
agent has been opened, the contents start to deteriorate. Any remaining
curing agent must be discarded two weeks after it is opened.
2.3.3 If mixing partial amounts, put the cap back on the curing agent
bottle immediately after taking the measured quantity. This prevents
evaporation and entry of moisture. If there is any sign of cloudiness
in the liquid, this indicates that moisture is present and the complete
contents of the bottle must be discarded.
2.3.4 Graduated measuring vessels must be used to make sure the two parts
are mixed together in the ration of 25 measures (by volume) of adhesive
to one measure of curing agent. The measuring vessels must be kept
clean and dry.
2.3.5 Keep the adhesive, curing agent and mixed adhesive in completely
sealed airtight containers.
2.3.6 Adhesive must not be used outside the temperature range
+5° to +30° C (41-86° F) or when the relative humidity exceeds 70%.
2.3.7 After the adhesive has been used to join surfaces, it will cure in two to
four days at 20°C (68°F). At higher temperatures the curing time will be
reduced, and at lower temperatures the curing time will increase.
2.3.8 For each batch of mixed adhesive, keep a sample and monitor it for
development of cure. Use the sample to join two pieces of fabric. Keep
the joined fabric as proof of the quality of the adhesive bond.
CAUTION: THE COMPONENTS AND MIXED ADHESIVE MUST BE
KEPT IN COMPLETELY SEALED AIRTIGHT CONTAINERS.
MIXED SOLUTION BECOMES UNUSABLE AFTER A
FEW HOURS AND CAN NOT BE STORED FOR LONGER
PERIODS.
2.3.9 The mixed adhesive will thicken and become unusable within four to six
hours. This time depends on workshop temperature and the quantity
of exposure to air. If the adhesive can be easily applied as a normal
smooth and even layer, it is still usable.

3. Preparation of coated surfaces.
3.1 Rubber-proofed surfaces
WARNING: ONLY COATED SURFACES MAY BE INCLUDED IN REPAIRS.
CAUTION: THOROUGHLY CLEAN RUBBER PROOFED SURFACES
WITH RECOMMENDED SOLVENT (REFER TO
CHAPTER 3, CLEANING, TABLE 301 CLEANING
SOLVENTS AND MATERIALS) AND/OR SOAP AND WATER
TO REMOVE SURFACE CONTAMINATION COMPLETELY.
TOLUENE MUST BE USED TO PRIME THE RUBBER
SURFACES, BY AGGRESSIVELY WIPING WITH A CLEAN
SOAKED RAG.
3.1.1 The Nylon fabric used for air-holding chambers has a heavy-duty rubber
coating which has been compounded to give a high resistance to
abrasion.
3.1.2 These rubber coated fabrics must be prepared for bonding by priming
the coated surfaces with the solvent Toluene and allow the solvent to
dry off.
3.1.3 Apply the solvent with a clean lint-free fabric pad, wet but not dripping
with the solvent.
3.1.4 Apply the first coat of adhesive immediately after the Toluene has dried
off.
3.1.5 Do not remove residual adhesive from seaming surfaces which have
been separated, unless it can be easily peeled off. To make a smooth
surface, use toluene to rub off the old adhesive.
3.2 Polyurethane (PU)-proofed surfaces
WARNING: ONLY COATED SURFACES MAY BE INCLUDED IN REPAIRS.
CAUTION: THOROUGHLY CLEAN PU PROOFED SURFACES WITH
TOLUENE SOLVENT (REFER TO CHAPTER 3, CLEANING,
TABLE 301 CLEANING SOLVENTS AND MATERIALS)
AND/OR SOAP AND WATER TO REMOVE SURFACE

CAUTION: MEK (METHYL ETHYL KETONE) MUST BE USED TO
CORRECTLY PRIME THE HEAVY DUTY POLYURETHANE
COATING ON THE MATERIAL USED FOR THE BUOYANCY
TUBES (FLOOR, ETC).
TOLUENE OR PETROLEUM TYPE CLEANING SOLVENTS
ARE NOT EFFECTIVE FOR THIS PURPOSE.
3.2.1 PU coated fabrics must be prepared for bonding by chemically priming
the coated surfaces with the solvent MEK immediately as soon as the
solvent has evaporated, but within 10-20 seconds before application of
the coat of adhesive. You may experiment with identical fabrics to find
the optimum time within which the adhesive must be applied, at any
given temperature.
NOTE: After 10-20 seconds the prepared surface will become
less receptive to the adhesive.
3.2.2 Apply the solvent with a clean lint-free fabric pad, wet but not dripping
with the solvent. Adequate preparation of the surface is shown by the
development of a matt appearance and a limited degree of tackiness.
The pad should become discoloured.
3.2.3 Attempts to prime PU surfaces chemically in a hot humid environment
can cause the formation of atmospheric dew. This is because rapid
evaporation of the MEK solvent causes the surface temperature
to decrease. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO JOIN SURFACES IN THESE
CONDITIONS, AS POOR ADHESION WILL RESULT.
3.2.4 Repeated applications of MEK solvent on a clean PU surface tend to
become less effective. Apply the first coat of adhesive immediately after
the first MEK wipe.
3.2.5 Do not remove residual adhesive from seaming surfaces which have
been separated, unless it can be easily peeled off. To make a smooth
surface, use toluene to rub off the old adhesive.
3.3 Alternative surface preparation of coated surfaces to MEK
3.3.1 The prepared area must be lightly abraded, using a 80-180 grit sand
paper, until a matt (dull) surface finish is achieved.
CAUTION: DO NOT OVER ABRADE THE PU AREA. THIS WILL
RESULT IN DAMAGE TO THE PU MATERIAL.
3.3.2 As a result of the abrasion, surface debris will be created from the PU.
This must be dry wiped off, using lint free cloth.
3.3.3 RFD 549 structural adhesive, is then applied onto the debris-free PU
surface. This must be done in accordance with the service manual

4. Application of adhesive. Bostik 486 or Alpha S 5001 adhesive:
4.1 For the purposes of repair, the words ‘tacky’ and aggressive tack’ are defined
thus:
4.1.1 When the word ‘tacky’ is used, it means that if the fingers are lightly
dragged across the adhesive, it tends to pull off the base material, or off
the previous coat.
4.1.2 When the expression ‘aggressive tack’ is used, this means that when
applying light finger pressure to the adhesive, the adhesive surface
tends to retain (stick to) the fingers and does not transfer from the base
fabric. When testing a surface with a finger, the adhesive must show
aggressive tack, but no adhesive should remain on the finger.
WARNING: NO TEXTILE JOINTS: WHEN JOINING TWO SURFACES
TOGETHER, MAKE SURE THE SURFACES ARE PROOF SIDE
TO PROOF SIDE. DO NOT USE THE TEXTILE SIDE FOR ANY
REPAIRS.
4.2 Apply three coats of adhesive to each mating surface. Allow each coat to
become tacky before applying subsequent coats.
4.3 When the third coat develops an aggressive tack, apply the patch or make the
seam. Roll well, with a hand roller, to remove any air bubbles, rucks or creases.
4.4 Take care when rolling down seams and patches, particularly on curved edges.
Avoid making rucks and creases. All seams MUST be rolled twice.
4.5 If a coat has dried, it may be relivened by a cloth dampened, but not dripping,
with toluene solvent. Apply just enough solvent to recreate an aggressive
tack on the surface. Relivening may be carried out, up to 3 hours after the
application of the first coat of adhesive, but no later.
4.6 Each repair must be completed within 3 hours of commencement.
NOTE: a DRY JOINT will result if: -The adhesive becomes too dry
between coats or at seam make-up.
-Any air bubbles are not completely rolled out.
-The mating surfaces are dry before patches are
positioned.
A dry joint may appear good but will be easily pulled apart.

CAUTION: DO NOT USE SOLVENTS TO REMOVE SURPLUS
ADHESIVE FROM REPAIR AREAS, UNLESS THE JOINT
HAS CURED THOROUGHLY.
NOTE: Adhesive must not be used outside the temperature range
+5° to +30° Celsius or when the relative humidity exceeds
70%.
After the adhesive has been used to join surfaces, it
will cure in two to four days at 20° Celsius. At higher
temperatures the curing time will be reduced and at lower
temperatures the curing time will increase.
For each batch of mixed adhesive, keep a sample and
monitor it for development of cure. Use the sample to join
two pieces of fabric. Keep the joined fabric as proof of the
quality of the adhesive bond.
5. Repair damaged areas
5.1 All of the seams in Marine MK IV liferafts, particularly the air holding seams, are
formed using adhesive. The liferaft buoyancy tubes, floor and canopy
(non air holding joints) are also held together with adhesive.
5.2 Note that a correct adhesive-jointed seam or assembly of rubber or PU proofed
fabric and adhesive, is very strong. It is possible to cause damage to the
proofed coat if careless attempts are made to tear apart two surfaces joined
by adhesive, particularly if forces are applied in a manner not normally found
during service.
WARNING: UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD THE HOT AIR GUN
BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH TOLUENE SOLVENT.
TOLUENE IS EXTREMELY FLAMMABLE AND MUST BE KEPT
AWAY FROM THE HOT AIR GUN.
NOTE: to RELEASE ADHESIVE JOINTED SEAMS or assemblies
formed using rubber or polychloroprene adhesive, it is
recommended that one of the following techniques is
used, together with the careful use of a spatula or other
suitable tool.
- A hot air gun (max. temperature 70°C [158°F] ) or
- Toluene solvent.

(b) If a repair to the canopy fabric will detract from the logo’s
appearance it is acceptable to completely remove the screen
printed ink. Use toluene to remove the ink. Make sure that the
completed repair work leaves the liferaft serviceable, clean
condition.
5.3.2 “Product brand” logo
(a) Repairs to the label or velcro are not permitted. Damaged or
illegible labels must be replaced.
5.3.3 Canopy velcro
(a) If the female velcro on the canopy is damaged or must be moved
to allow canopy fabric repair, it can be replaced as required.
5.4 Patches
Damage to pressure holding chambers requires the application of a single patch for
the repair, please refer to FIGURE 601.
Rubber coated patch:
• Marking out patches should be done using a wax or chinagraph pencil.
• Never use a ballpoint pen for this task.
PU coated patch:
• Repairs to fabrics normally consist of patching the damage with fabric
patches. The patching fabric must be the same type of material as the
item under repair.
(e.g. material RFD 1015 must be repaired using RFD 1015)
• When marking PU coated fabrics, use a silver ballpoint pen
(Schmidt 700) or BIC Crystal red Pen or wax crayon (e.g. Chinagraph).
• If a ‘major’ repair is carried out record the repairs on the liferaft log card.

necessary.
5.4.2 Repair patches on air-holding components may be made from either
fabric RFD1015,Type 1, P/N 10772009 (single-sided PU ‘proofing’)
or RFD1015,Type 2, P/N 10773009 (Double-sided PU ‘proofing’), or
Rubber P/N 08449009 or DSB 00220020.
5.4.3 Where other components are to be bonded on top of the patch use only
RFD1015 Type 2 Fabric, P/N 10773009 (Double-sided PU ‘proofing’), or
Rubber P/N 08449009 or DSB 00220020.
NOTE: MEK must not be used before adhesive is applied on
rubber surfaces
5.4.4 Cut the patch so that it overlaps the area of damage by at least
25 mm all round. Prepare the patch for gluing as per the requirements
in this Chapter.
5.4.5 Allow the adhesive to dry. Test it by touching the adhesive with the back
of a finger. If the adhesive is dry to the touch it is ready to be applied.
5.4.6 Apply adhesive to the outer repair patch as per the requirements in this
Chapter and allow to dry.
5.4.7 When the adhesive is touch dry, apply the patch to the repair area
ensuring it is centrally aligned.
5.4.8 Use a spatula or roller to expel the air from under the patch, ensuring
that there are no creases. Once again, press from the centre to the
edge. Allow sufficient time for the repair to cure (recommended 24
hours), before making a pressure test on the repaired chamber prior
folding and packing the liferaft.
5.5 Types of patches
5.5.1 Repair patches must overlap at least 25 mm (1”) beyond the edge of the
damage. Refer to FIGURE 602 e.g:
(b) If the diameter of a jagged aperture is 25 mm (1”), the patch must
be at least 75 mm (3 in) diameter.
(c) If a straight tear is 25 mm (1”) long, the patch must be at least 75
mm (3”) × 50 (2”) mm.
(d) Treat ‘L’ shaped tears as apertures; calculate the “diameter” as the
distance between the ends of the tear.

5.5.3 Repair patches on air-holding components may be made from the same
material as that of the air-holding chamber.
5.6 Applying patches and tapes
5.6.1 To apply patches or tapes, the following procedure must be followed:
(a) Cut the patch to size.
(b) Prepare and clean the area as described in Step 3.
(c) When the final adhesive coat develops an aggressive tack, put the
patch in position and use a hand roller to roll it into firm contact.
Make sure that the patch is orientated correctly i.e. ‘proof’ surface
to ‘proof’ surface. Adhesive joints are not permitted to join one or
more textile surfaces.
(d) Use a spatula to remove any air bubbles from under the patch.
(e) After a repair to an inflatable chamber has cured, the inflatable
chamber must be subjected to a pressure holding test.
(f) If damage is along the edge of a seam then the patch must extend
across the central seam joint by a minimal 25 mm (1”).
Refer to FIGURE 603.
5.6.2 To apply tape, use exactly the same manner that is used for patches.
Cut a radius on the corners of the tape ends before sticking the

5.10 Righting strap repair
The liferaft has a righting strap attached to the underside of the liferaft.
Refer to FIGURE 604. To prevent the righting strap from becoming tangled
during deployment, it is held securely against the liferaft floor by two fixing
strips. These fixing strips can be pulled free of the floor when required. The
fixing strips have two pre-cut notches that provide a weak point at which the
strips will break when pulled. To replace the fixing strips when necessary the
following procedure must be used:
To replace fixing strips:
5.10.1 Remove the used fixing strip by carefully peeling away from the liferaft
surface. Make sure that no other liferaft components are damaged or
affected.
5.10.2 Prepare the outer surface of the liferaft floor and the textile side of the
fixing strip, as instructed in Section 3 of this chapter.
5.10.3 Apply adhesive to the textile surface of the fixing strip.
Refer to FIGURE 605. Apply adhesive only to the ends of the fixing
strip, stopping 5 mm from the pre-cut notch.
5.10.4 Apply adhesive to the areas of the liferaft floor where the original fixing
strip was attached.
NOTE: Preparation of this surface is unnecessary, assuming it is
clean, dry and free from debris.
5.10.5 Position the righting strap between the two areas of adhesive on the
liferaft floor.
5.10.6 Apply the textile surface of the fixing strip to the two areas of adhesive
on the liferaft floor. Refer to FIGURE 605. Make sure that the righting
strap webbing is secured between the fixing strip and the liferaft floor.
5.10.7 Make sure that the righting strap webbing is free to slide through the
‘channel’ created by the fixing strip.
5.10.8 Check to make sure that the fixing strip is affixed to the liferaft floor at
the intended areas of attachment.
5.11 More extensive damage
5.11.1 Repairs not described in this manual are not permitted except by
permission from the Design Authority, Survitec Group Ltd. Separate
application must be made for each occasion when repair is proposed.

6.3 Inflation valve
Leafield type (FIGURE 608)
6.3.1 The inflation valves have different jet bores, as stated below. The size of
the jet bore is stamped in the flat surface of the valve body. The stamp
also shows the direction of the jet holes.
(a) The bore size for the lower buoyancy is 2.2 mm.
(b) The bore size for the upper buoyancy is 2.8 mm.
6.3.2 There is only one size of hose for this valve.
6.3.3 The assembly requires an aperture of 24 mm diameter in the buoyancy
tube. The aperture is reinforced at this point.
(a) Deflate the liferaft for this repair.
(b) To install an inflation valve access to the inside of the buoyancy
tube is required. This is achieved by making a slit in the buoyancy
tube, approximately 150 mm (6”) long. The slit is required close to
the inlet valve position.
(c) To disassemble the inflation valve, remove the fixing nut and the
plastic washer from the valve.
(d) Reach inside the liner, via this slit, and pull the body of the valve to
the inside of the liner, then remove it from the buoyancy tube.
(e) To install a new inflation valve, first disassemble the nut and the
plastic washer from the valve.
(f) Using all new components assemble the inflation valve unit.
Pass the valve body through the liner and the 24 mm hole in the
buoyancy tube.

Refer to the steps below for the KLAPPE method of packing a DSB LR07 DL Liferaft.
5.1 Put the liferaft neatly on a packing table in an open area, with enough room
to manoeuvre the container during packing. The inflation valves must be
positioned adjacent to the edge of the packing table. Make sure that all cordage
is neat and tidy. When most of the air has escaped naturally from the liferaft, it
must be evacuated as follows:
5.1.1 Connect a vacuum device to a deflation adapter and evacuate all air
from each compartments. Re-cap the inflate/deflate valves in each
compartment.
5.1.2 As each chamber is evacuated, adjust the buoyancy tubes so that they
lie flat on each other.
5.2 Join the lifting bridle cords in four equal groups, at their mid point, using velcro
strips. Do this for each quadrant of the liferaft, as shown in FIGURE 801A. This
will keep cords away from the door openings and will also prevent entangling.
5.3 Check the red webbing ring pull and container retaining line is serviceable.
5.4 Replace the container restraint label if it is torn or illegible.
Refer to FIGURE 801A.
5.5 Tie the container retaining line (1818 kgf (4000 lbf) Nylon cord 5.5 m (216”)
long, to the suspension ring using a bowline knot and tape the flying end.

7. Heat shrink sleeve. Refer to FIGURE 862.
To encapsulate crimps with a heat shrink sleeve the following procedures
must be observed. Refer to Chapter 11, ILLUSTRATED PARTS LIST for part
numbers.
7.1 Slide the strap through the heat shrink sleeve. Keep the strap ID tag as close
as possible to the crimp - the maximum installed separation between these is
10 mm.
7.2 Apply the tensioning tool to the strap at a point half way across the two rims.
Operate the handle to tension the strap until the base of the tensioning tool
rests in the lower container rim. Secure the strap with a crimp.
NOTE: The sleeve must be sitting loose in this temporary location.
It must not be snagged against the container and strap or
between the crimp and strap.
7.3 Using scissors, carefully cut the tail of the strap as close as possible to the
crimp, but do not trim off the strap ID tag. The maximum distance permitted
between the end of the tail and the crimp is 15 mm.
CAUTION: USE THE CORRECT HEAT SHRINK TOOL.
REFER TO CHAPTER 10, SPECIAL TOOLS, EQUIPMENT
AND MATERIALS.
CAUTION: A HEAT SETTING GREATER THAN 6 WILL OVERHEAT
THE STRAP. DO NOT OVERHEAT THE STRAP. DO NOT
POINT THE HEAT GUN DIRECTLY AT THE STRAP. IF YOU
SEE DISCOLOURATION IN THE STRAP, IT HAS BEEN
OVERHEATED. IN THIS CASE IT MUST BE DISCARDED,
REMOVED AND A REPLACED.
WARNING: BE VARY CAREFUL WITH THE HEAT GUN. ALLOW SUFFICIENT
TIME FOR PARTS TO COOL BEFORE HANDLING DIRECTLY.
THE HEAT GUN NOZZLE WILL REMAIN HOT AFTER USE.
7.4 With the heat gun at setting at 6, apply heat evenly over the heat shrink sleeve.
The rear of the heat shrink sleeve must be heated evenly from both left and
right hand sides.
7.5 Make sure that the entire crimp and tail are completely encapsulated and that
the heat shrink sleeve overlaps in both directions by at least 5 mm.
7.6 Using protective gloves, pinch the ends of the heat shrink while it is cooling, to
make sure that they have sealed tight against the strap.

WARNING: THE HEATED WELDING HAND TOOL AND WELDED AREAS
ARE VERY HOT. IT IS IMPERATIVE TO TAKE CAUTION WHEN
YOU USE THE HEATED WELDING HAND TOOL TO AVOID
INJURY.
9.43 Use the heated welding hand tool to weld the two sheets of the H-Pack
together:
9.43.1 Make sure that the painter sachet is in the correct position.
Refer to Figure 899N (i).
9.43.2 Plug the heated welding hand tool into a suitable mains outlet. Leave
alone to heat up on setting three for 5-10 minutes to allow the tool to
stabilise.
9.43.3 Do a test of the heated welding hand tool on a sample H-Pack to make
sure that it is at the correct temperature and is functioning correctly.
9.43.4 Gently try to pull the welded edges apart to test the welds. Make sure
that they are firmly welded together.
9.43.5 Do step 6.41.3 again if you are in doubt. Avoid pleats if it is possible.
9.43.6 Start at the left corner of the H-pack.
9.43.7 Put the two sheets inside the tool and clamp the jaws of the tool
together by squeezing the tool handles firmly for 3-5 seconds then
release hand pressure.
9.43.8 Seal the two sheets together along the 150 mm section (the length of
the tool) and then slide the tool along the length of the sheet and clamp
again to seal the next section. Refer to Figure 899N (ii).
NOTE: Overlap each weld by a minimum of 10 mm lengthwise to
make sure that there are no unsealed gaps left between
the sheets.
9.43.9 Complete the heat seal so that it leaves 15 mm nominal weld width
(minimum 10 mm) from the edge of the H-Pack.
9.43.10 The heated welding hand tool should be worked around the perimeter
of the H-Pack until the liferaft is close to being concealed within the two
sheets.
9.43.11 Gently pull the welded edges apart to test the welds.
9.43.12 Do the relevant steps again to seal the two sheets if they have came
apart.

1. General
1.1 Storage conditions for liferafts depend on whether they have been
Operationally Packed.
2. Liferafts that have not been operationally packed
2.1 A liferaft that is not operationally packed must be stored in a room that:
2.1.1 Can be maintained at a temperature of 15 to 21°C (59 to 70°F)
2.1.2 Is free from direct sunlight
2.1.3 Has a dry atmosphere
2.1.4 Is free from corrosive fumes or other harmful contamination
2.2 Remove accessories that are easily detachable. Attach transit caps and recoil
caps to the cylinder. Obey proper procedures on how to store the gas cylinder.
2.3 Deflate the liferaft until the fabric creases are sharp and well defined.
Refer to Chapter 8, ASSEMBLY AND REPACKING.
2.4 Fold the liferaft to a manageable size.
2.5 Wrap opaque polyethylene film around the liferaft. This will protect it against
the effect of UV light. The polyethylene must be in accordance with ISO 2230
Section 5.2.
2.6 Tie a label to the liferaft recording the following:
2.6.1 Liferaft Type, Mark and Serial Number.
2.6.2 Date of last inflation test.
2.6.3 Date of last service.
CAUTION: DO NOT STORE MORE THAN THREE LIFERAFTS ON TOP
OF ONE ANOTHER.
2.7 Store the liferaft above floor level, preferably on slatted shelving to permit air
circulation.
2.8 Store the liferaft accessories, except the gas cylinders, with the liferaft.
2.9 Attach dust caps to the hoses. If dust caps for the hoses are not available, use
adhesive tape to keep dirt out of the hoses.

3. Storage limiting period
3.1 Following a service, the storage limiting period for the liferaft is 12 months,
provided that the storage conditions comply with approved standards
(Paragraph A above) and meet with the concurrence of the approval authority
of the country concerned. At the end of that period the liferaft must be:
3.1.1 unfolded and inspected, before further storage, or
3.1.2 serviced and tested, before being operationally packed for installation
on a vessel.
3.2 A liferafts which is not operationally packed and placed in store for more than
30 days must be re-tested before being operationally packed and installed on a
vessel. Refer to Chapter 5, TESTING AND TROUBLESHOOTING.
3.3 If a liferaft is operationally packed in a container, it can operate in a wide range
of temperature and humidity, equivalent to those found in service worldwide.
Always make sure the drainage holes in the bottom of the container point
straight down; make sure they are not blocked by dirt. Do not deliberately make
containers wet.
3.3.1 Do not direct water from hoses at containers.
3.3.2 Do not leave containers in flooded places.
3.4 All lines which go through the container to the liferaft must have protective
sheaths at their outer ends. These sheaths will prevent water from seeping into
the container. If a line has been pulled from the container to expose a part of
the line which is not covered by a sheath, contact a Service Station to repack
the liferaft as soon as possible.
3.5 If you need to move a container do not roll it. Get help to lift the container.
3.6 Operationally packed liferafts are approved for use on board ship for at least
12 months. National Authorities may grant extensions to the original operational
period. At the end of a period of operational use, Survitec Group recommend
that all liferafts should immediately be opened for inspection and service.
Any contaminants inside the container must be removed before they cause
damage.

depending on the container type being used.
1.1.2 Drainage slits:
(a) The container has drainage holes. These holes allow water to
escape. Plastic sheets are then placed inside the container before
the liferaft is rolled inside
CAUTION: WATER CAN COLLECT INSIDE THE LIFERAFT IF THERE
ARE NO DRAINAGE SLITS IN THE PLASTIC SHEET.
(b) Check that there are drainage holes in the bottom of the container.
(c) Line the bottom half of the container with a polythene sheet.
Refer to FIGURE A7-3.
(d) Make sure that this sheet overlaps the front edge of the container

3. Test procedures
3.1 Post-Operational Packing Vacuum Test
CAUTION: SILVER SERIES LIFERAFTS MUST ONLY BE TESTED USING
THE CORRECT MANOMETER.
After every service, each liferaft must be subject to this test. This ensures
that the liferaft’s hermetic seal has not been compromised during service. A
record of this test must be completed on a form similar to that given in Chapter 5,
TESTING AND TROUBLESHOOTING.. Such records must be kept by the
service station for a minimum of 10 years after the service date.
These records must be available on demand, for inspection by staff of Eurovinil.
A similar record must be made when a service station operationally packs a
new liferaft.
Do this test after the top half of the container has been installed and the straps/
crimps are installed. If desired the technician is permitted to perform this test
prior to the installation of the container upper half. This will be an additional
test and does not need to be recorded but does not negate the requirement to
perform the official test.
3.2 Persons permitted to perform test
The Post-Operational Packing Vacuum Test may only be completed (including
recording – see subsequent Section) by two technicians who are trained,
qualified and competent in packing Eurovinil liferafts in question.

3.3 POPVT Details
3.3.1 Ensure the nut, (Item 2 FIGURE A7-28), has been torqued correctly.
Please refer to Chapter 1, TABLE 1 for correct torque values.
3.3.2 Remove Plug, (Item 1 FIGURE A7-28), using the correct tool and a
suitable 3/8” square drive wrench.
3.3.3 Insert a standard airline A8 adaptor into the vacuum plug hole. Connect
the airline to a vacuum capable of sustaining 5 psi (gauge).
3.3.4 Vacuum down the H-pack to between 5-6 psi, through the point from
which the plug was removed.
CAUTION: A VACUUM OF 6 PSI MUST NOT BE EXCEEDED. WORK
QUICKLY THROUGH THE FOLLOWING STEP ONCE
VACUUM IS APPLIED. DO NOT LEAVE THE VACUUM ON
FOR MORE THAN 20 MINUTES AT A TIME.
3.3.5 Record the “Start Pressure”.
3.3.6 Do not touch the liferaft for at least five minutes.
3.3.7 Record the “End Pressure”.
NOTE: “End Pressure” must not be corrected for atmospheric/
temperature fluctuations. During the five-minute test it
is permissible to temporarily bung the valve body using
either the plug provided with the H-pack, or a clean rubber
bung from a standard Leafield A8 top-up valve. If using the
plug, this will form a reliable temporary seal when hand-
tightened.
3.3.8 Calculate the % gain of pressure (equal to the percentage loss of
vacuum). This is calculated as follows:
{ (Start Pressure – End Pressure)}
% gain = 100
Start Pressure
3.3.9 Insert a deflator pin into the vacuum valve body and leave the liferaft
to settle to atmospheric pressure. (This takes approximately 5-10
minutes). When atmospheric pressure has been reached, a pressure
reading will return 0 psi
3.3.10 Fit the plug provided with the H-Pack (Item 1 FIGURE A7-28). Torque
plug into vacuum valve body, using the correct tool and a calibrated 3/8”
square drive torque wrench. Ensure that silicone grease does not come
into contact with any threadforms on the plug or vacuum valve body.

NOTE: The plug supplied with H-Pack has an integral O-ring
(Item 3 FIGURE A7-28). Silicone grease is already
provided on the O-ring. This is sufficient for re-fitting
the plug directly, provided the plug has been kept free
of contaminants and grease provided hasn’t been wiped
off. If in any doubt, remove the O-ring using a suitable
non-sharp implement and discard. Clean the plug using a
clean lint-free cloth and refit a new O-ring coated liberally
with silicone grease.

2. Packing a standard DSB LR07 Davit-launch liferaft into a container
2.1 Put the liferaft neatly on a packing table in an open area, with enough room
to manoeuvre the container during packing. The inflation valves should be
positioned adjacent to the edge of the packing table. Make sure that all cordage
is neat and tidy.
When most of the air has escaped naturally from the liferaft, it must be
evacuated as follows:
2.1.1 Connect a vacuum device to a deflation adapter and evacuate all air
from each compartments. Re-cap the inflate/deflate valves in each
compartment.
2.1.2 As each chamber is evacuated, adjust the buoyancies so that they lie
flat on each other.
2.2 Join the lifting bridle cords into four equal groups, at their mid point, using
velcro tapes. Do this for each quadrant of the liferaft. Refer to FIGURE 801.
This will keep cords away from the door openings and will also prevent
entangling.
2.3 Refer to Appendix 12 for guidance on installing and checking a Leafield GIST
operating head.
WARNING: DO NOT REMOVE THE RECOIL CAPS FROM THE OPERATING
HEAD YET.
2.4 Upturn the edge of the liferaft to reveal the cylinder stowage pocket/straps.
Refer to FIGURE A9-2. Slide the cylinder into the cylinder stowage
arrangement, taking care not to trap the righting strap.
The cylinder must be orientated, so that the upper buoyancy operating
head outlet runs parallel with the base of the liferaft while the other runs
perpendicular towards the water. Refer to FIGURE A9-2.
2.5 Attach the cord to the cylinder neck.
2.5.1 Cylinder pockets: Using the cord attached to the cylinder stowage
pocket, tie the cylinder neck securely. Put 2 turns around the cylinder
neck and tie with a reef knot and 2 half hitches.

gap (about 100 mm [4”]) between the table and the side of the container. Tilt
the lower half of the container slightly towards the table to make rolling and
packing easier.
2.10 Grasp the edge of the liferaft and with the cylinder, drag the assembly over the
container so that the cylinder lies correctly in the container.
Refer to FIGURE A9-3.
2.10.1 MK 10 CONTAINER:
The top edge of the cylinder must be level with the inner container lip.
Refer to FIGURE A9-4 Detail A.
The operating head must be 100 mm from the container end.
2.10.2 MK 14 CONTAINER:
The cylinder must be placed in the centre and with the operating head
100 mm from the container end. Refer to FIGURE A9-4 Detail B.
2.11 The cylinder must be placed evenly, on top of the two yellow DL straps. This
makes sure the that cylinder will lift out of the container, with the liferaft, during
Davit-launch Adjust the straps accordingly so that the cylinder body is well
placed onto them. Refer to FIGURE A9-3. Tape the straps into place.
