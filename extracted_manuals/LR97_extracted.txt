1 Description
1.1 General
The LR 97-liferafts are made for 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 20 and
25 persons and meet the following requirements referring for
construction and equipment: :
1. 1983 Amendments to the International Convention for the
Safety of Life at Sea 1974, Chapter III, with amendments
and are tested according to:
2. Testing and Evaluation of LIVE-SAVING APPLIANCES
1992 Edition, IMO Resolution A.689(17) and amendments
3. Scheme for the Reciprocal Recognition of Tests and
Inspections carried out on Ships Equipment -
- Common Requirements for Inflatable Liferafts
1.2 Constructional features
1.2.1 Raft and canopy material
All liferafts are made of one layer of polyamide fabric coated with
rubber proofing on both sides.
1.2.2 Shape of Liferafts
for 6 and 8 persons rectangular
for 10, 12 and 16 persons hexagonal
for 20 and 25 persons octagonal
1.2.3 Buoyancy tubes

============================================================
PÁGINA 12
============================================================
1.2.4 Arch tube
All liferafts are equipped with inflatable arch tube(s). The arch tube(s) is/are
inflated from the upper buoyancy tube via non-return valve(s). These non-
return valves prevent the arch(es) from deflating should the upper tube be
damaged. The arch(es) is/are also equipped with a topping up and deflation
valve.
1.2.5 Canopy
The canopy consists of a blue fabric inside and a luminous-orange fabric on
the outside.
The rectangular liferafts have one boarding entrance each while the hexagonal
and octagonal liferafts are provided with two boarding entrances.
A catchment gutter on the canopy collects rain water and conducts the water
through a hose into the raft.
1.2.6 Floor
The two-layer floor is attached to the lower side of the lower buoyancy tube.
The floor is inflated by means of an inflate/deflate valve and bellows.
After inflation the floor shows a stitched structure and provides insulation
against the water underneath. The floor area measures 0.372 square metre
for each person the liferaft can accommodate.
The underside of the floor is fitted with water pockets to provide stability and
reduce drift. They fill automatically when the raft is deployed.
The underside of the floor is also provided with an arrangement for righting
the liferaft in case of inflation in an inverted position.
1.2.7 Inflation arrangement
All liferafts have a pressure gas cylinder with a screw in type valve and
operating head.
The filling gas is C02/ N2 . When activated the gas passes through a
high-pressure hose with a Y-distributor and then through two other
high-pressure hoses separately into the upper and lower buoyancy tubes.

a) A grab line is mounted around the inner and outer circumference of
the liferaft.
b) A safety knife is located on the upper buoyancy tube, on the right
hand side of the entrance adjacent to the painter line.
c) Two independent lamps, one located on the outside of the canopy,
the other attached to the arch inside the raft, are powered by dry
lithium cells which are also located on the arch inside the raft.
The cells are automatically activated during inflation.
d) A rescue quoit with line is located in a bag attached to the inner canopy.
On Danish approved liferafts the rescue quoit is attached to the upper
buoancy tube.
e) A sea anchor is attached to a patch on the lower buoyancy tube,
at right angles to the boarding entrances.
f) Liferafts manufactured in accordance with German and Norwegian
approvals are equipped with a self draining system.
g) The emergency equipment is stowed in a valise, which is fastened to the
inner floor of the liferaft.
h) Bellows, bailer, repair bag and rainwater collecting bags are stowed in a bag
attached to the internal lifeline.
i) Liferafts approved by the German Shipping Authority are provided with two
textile radar reflectors mounted on the outer canopy. In all other liferafts one
radar reflector is stowed in the emergency pack, provided this is required by
the relevant national authority.
Additional equipment for davit-launched liferafts:
j) A bowsing line is fitted to the upper buoyancy tube each side of the boarding
entrance above the gas cylinder, for securing the raft to the liferaft embarkation
point.

3.4.2 Disconnecting the CO2-cylinder with operating head
Ensure that all personnel are made aware of the following safeguards
when handling compressed gas cylinders !
a) Observe official rules concerning compressed gas!
b) Do not use any compressed gas cylinders the contents of which are
not well known and/or which:
- are not provided with an official inspection mark
- show signs of corrosion or traces of burning and / or
any other severe damage (such as deformation,
incision or unauthorised modifications);
- are furnished with distorted or otherwise damaged valves
- give rise to objections in any other way.
Such cylinders must be discharged*, withdrawn from use and the
empty cylinders sent to DSB for further examination.
(*) Note: Cylinders, the contents of which are unknown, should
be discharged only by an acknowledged expert with due
consideration for the necessary precautions !
c) Compressed gas cylinders with incomplete and not clearly readable
marking must not be used.
d) Do not store more cylinders in the working room than will be required
as a maximum for one shift. Cylinders not required should be securely
stored in suitable racking to guard against shock or movement, in a
separate room.
e) Full or empty cylinders kept in the working room should be securely
stored in suitable racking to guard against shock or movement.
f) Cylinders kept in the working room and not destined for immediate
use should be stored in such a way that in the event of a valve rupture,
the risk to persons by flying components and / or he recoil of the cylinder
is reduced to a minimum.
g) Cylinders charged with compressed gas should never be left uncon-
trolled and/or be placed in the vicinity of doors, gangways and emer-
gency excapes.
h) Filled cylinders should be protected from heat.

i) The following recommendations should be observed when examining
cylinders charged with compressed gas and when assembling or
adjusting their valves:
- wear full protection goggles,
- never direct assembly axis (i.e. possible „line of fire“
in case of valve rupture) and/or valve discharge opening
towards oneself or other persons. (This applies also to
transport and mounting of cylinders in the raft).
j) In case of distorted valves diverging from the cylinder axis:
Do not operate, do not perform any assembly work. Unscrew
operating head cautiously without strong effort and discharge
cylinder - see item 3.4.8. Send cylinder to DSB for examination
and repair.
k) When mounting or dismounting cylinders charges with compressed
gas, or during testing or assembly procedures, no persons should be
allowed to stay in front of the valve or behind the cylinder bottom.
l) Leakages around the valve fittings of C0 -cylinders:
2
Don’t tighten valve connection !
Further handling see point 3.4.7.1.
m) Cylinders that have been rejected, or those with valves that have
been rejected, should only be shipped in discharged condition.
n) For test inflation of liferafts:
Safety range for observers = at least twice the maximum diameter
of the raft, standing behind the operating line.
On smooth floor the raft should, if necessary, be secured by ropes
to prevent it dragging.
o) Always keep in mind:
Compressed gas cylinders are completely harmless if correctly
handled, but are highly dangerous and uncontrollable if wrongly
handled!
3.4.2.1 Lift one side of the raft and put it on two stools so that the gas
cylinder is easily to hand.
3.4.2.2 Untie and put aside the valve-protective cap.
3.4.2.3 Unscrew the high pressure hose from the cylinder valve using an open
spanner (size 19 or 22)

the valve openings into all raft compartments)
Important ! Pressure relief valve plugs must have been removed
from the valves.
Attention ! Identify the type of topping up and deflation valve before
inflation, testing und deflation of buoyancy tubes and
floor. Select the appropriate test socket accordingly
(see Annex 11).
3.6.1 Inflate the raft using a compressed air line or compressed air cylinder with a
handwheel valve, until the pressure relief valves blow off. Should the pressure
relief valves not blow off, exercise care as there is a danger the raft will be
over-inflated.
Attach the pressure manometer, using the test socket, and ensure the maximum
pressure of 360 mbar (270 mm hg) has not been exceeded.
3.6.2 Working pressure test (WP)
Commence 30 minutes after the pressure relief valves have closed.
Reseat pressures: LR 97 throw-over-board types must be greater than 200 mbar;
LR 97 L davit launch types must be greater than 250 mbar)
The pressure drop must not exceed more than 5 % after one hour.
3.6.2.1 If the raft should fail the working pressure test, the leak may be found by mixing
3 - 5 % soap suds in luke warm water and applying it on the tubes with a cloth,
sponge or flat brush. Checks should be made in the following order - all valves,
seams, raft body. Any leak will be visible immediately by the formation of small
bubbles. It is also possible to so-called „cauliflower“, an agglomeration of tiny
bubbles, will form on porous raft material.
3.6.2.2 Large leaks must be repaired properly, whereas small leaks are
covered with DSB cold vulcanising material or with the post impreg-
nating agent E 3003 after having cleaned the spot to be repaired with
toluene. (For repairs please refer to the „Instructions for Repair of
Pneumatic Boat Skins“) - Annex 7 -

3.8.2 Revision and maintenance
3.8.2.1 Check carefully when inflating the raft for maintenance that the activating
pins are pulled out of the batteries. This is achieved by a line connecting
the pins to the floor of the raft. If the pins are not pulled out, the procedure
should be repeated after shortening the line.
The removal of the activating pins from the batteries must be ensured.
After the pins have been removed the exterior lighting should have a flashing
light and the interior a constant light.
After having checked the functioning of the lights the interior and exterior
light have to be switched off with the on/off switching pin.
(See item 3.8.1.1 and 3.8.1.2, pos. 5)
3.8.2.2 Make a visual inspection of the battery / cell. Distortion of the housing indicates
it is electrolysed and the battery / cell must be replaced.

3.9 Testing of the pressure relief valves (safety valves)
Product pressure relief valve: Thanner DK OTS
(Before starting the test, make sure the caps of the pressure
relief valves are removed!)
3.9.1 Connect the manometer / test pressure gauge to the tube being tested
- pay attention to ANNEX 11 - (first test of lower buoyancy tube)
Inflate raft by means of a compressor or pressed air test cylinder until the
relief valves open. Check the pressure at which the relief valve opened.
Allow the valve to reseat and check the pressure again. The opening and
closing pressures should be within the following scope:
type opening pressure closing pressure
(colour code)
OTS 65  0,230 bar minimum 0,200 bar
(yellow)
OTS 65  0,300 bar minimum 0,250 bar
(red)
If the opening and closing pressures should not meet the requirements
as stated above, repeat the inflation test several times. If the valve still
does not work properly the valve upper part must be replaced according
to item 3.9.3. The complete valve can only be replaced at the works.
Checking the relief valve caps
After completing the above test, adjust the pressure in each compartment
to the minimum closing pressure. Close the relief valves with the cap and
check for airtightness with soap suds.
If the valve screw connection should be leaking, it can be tightened using
the special socket wrench (figure stamp 20, DSB-Art.-No.: 0.11.06.62.0,
starting torque 35 Nm).
3.9.2. Remove caps after having completed the above check

- cap with sealing flange, DSB-Art.-No.: 0.08.10.08.0
The buoyancy tube is inflated. Loosen the upper part of the valve using the
special socket wrench (figure stamp 20). Then deflate the buoyancy tube.
When deflated unscrew the upper part from the lower part. Now undertake
the exchange.
(pay attention to the succession shown in the sketch above)
The grooves of the sealing flange must press the buoyancy tube material
Inflate the buoyancy tube when valve upper part is manual screwed.
Then tighten it with special socket wrench (figure stamp 20) with 35 Nm.
A leakage and function test must be carried out after completion of the above.

3.13 Hydrostatic release unit
The hydrostatic release unit replaces the manually operated slip-hook
for the automatic release of the lashing belt. It automatically opens the
lashing in 1,5 to 4 m depth of water and thus releases the packed liferaft
from the sinking vessel.
3.13.1 Type"Hammar H 20"
This hydrostatic release unit does not have to be serviced.
After a period of 2 years it has to be exchanged by a new one.
The time limit of two years starts counting from the month of mounting
the release unit on board. The data tape (in several languages) glued
to the hydrostatic release unit consists of 12 spaces for the month entry
and 3 spaces for the year entry. This tape must be marked with 2 year
time limit prior to mounting hydrostatic release unit on board.
The relevant month and year have to be scratched out.
Should hydrostatic release units be found on board of vessels without
any marking or not clearly marked they have to be replaced by new
ones immediately.
The serial-number of the newly installed hydrostatic release unit has to be
recorded on the log card of the liferaft.
The hydrostatic release unit packed in its original packing can be
obtained from DSB. DSB-Art.-No.: 0.07.09.31.
A mounting picture and working instructions are printed on the
packing carton. The packing carton also contains instructions for
installation intended for display on board.

4. Folding and packing of the liferaft
Only completely dry rafts are allowed to be packed.
Special attention should be paid to ropes and belt straps.
4.1 Completing the liferaft
4.1.1 General
Use a suction pump or decompressor to deflate the air compartments
after carrying out the „final check before deflation“ - see item 4.1.3.
Effective deflation is a prerequisite for proper packing of the raft into
container.
The buoyancy tubes, arch tube and the floor are deflated through the
inflate/deflate valves provided inside the raft. For deflation, the deflation
adaptor - with green cap, Art.-No. 8.07.33.04.0 - should be inserted into
the valve.
Deflation can be regarded as complete when the rubberized fabric
can be folded sharply and spread out on the top of each other.
Then, with the decompressor still running, the deflation adaptor should be
removed quickly from the valve and the valve cap closed
immediately.
Use of the valve cap will ensure the compartments will not reinflate
and further ensure there will be no leakage during gas inflation using
the rafts own C0 cylinder.

Put on the upper half of the container and make the following checks:
1) The upper half of the container must be resting on the raft body
2) The edges of the upper and lower halves of the container must
meet at least halfway.
If the edges of the container do not meet properly the raft roll is too loose
and the raft will have to be tightened further using the auxiliary belts.
If the upper half does not rest on the raft body even though it has the
correct pack length, loosen the auxiliary belts slightly until the container
does rest on the raft body.
The centre of gravity of the container can be found in table 4.3.3.4.6
The raft may now be rolled out of the lower half of the container.
If not done previously, place the pack belts, flax webbing,
Art. no. 0.03.01.05.0, alongside the auxiliary belts around the raft
and securely tie them using double knots.
Remove the auxiliary belts !
4.3.3.2 Check of container
Re-examine each container half to make sure that the inside is free of foreign
bodies, that they are dry und clean, that the water drain holes in the lower half
are open and that the rubber sealing profile is not damaged.
Slightly damaged GFK containers may be repaired in a suitable workshop.
In case of serious damage to a container, it must be replaced. Damaged,
brittle or cracked rubber sealing profiles must be replaced using adhesive 2444.
Styropor foam linings that are damaged or crushed must be replaced using
adhesive 2397.
Replace labels as necessary.
The self adhesive service label has only one line. Existing information must be
removed and new information inserted. This information must include the date
of service, the date of next service and the name of the station carrying out the
service.
We recommend the use of DYMO Electronic Labelmaker 4500, black printed
tape or similar.

Service instructions for hydrostatic release unit (HRU)
„Thanner DK 84“ and „Thanner DK 84.1“
1. The HRU and the weak link must be serviced in intervals of at least
12 months by an authorized service station.
Visual inspection
When a HRU is received for service a visual inspection must be
carried out:
a) Possible coats of paint must be removed and it is
important to ensure that the water entering holes on
the reverse side of the membrane flange are clean.
4 entering holes (production-no. 110111-127798)
3 entering holes ( " " 127799-)
b) After this the correct release pressure must be tested
in the test tank (see item 7 for instructions for test tank).
c) For the test the HRU is pre-tensioned with a force of
100 N by operating the load lever.
d) The release pressure must not reach 4000 mm water
column (approx. 157 inches / o,4 bar).
2. If the HRU does not release at the described pressure it must be detached
from the test tank and activated manually as follows:
a) Press down the release mechanism (PUSH TO RELEASE)
with a pin and open the locking catch.
b) Close the locking catch again and turn the index-bolt to
position "I". A clear „click“ indicates that the locking catch
has rested and that the HRU is functioning again.

============================================================
1. GAS INFLATION TEST (GI)
A gas inflation (GI) test should be carried out at 5-year intervals, and when under-
taking a gas inflation test, special attention should be paid to the effectiveness of
the relief valves. The folded liferaft should be removed from its container before
activating the fitted gas inflation system. After gas inflation has been initiated,
sufficient time should be allowed to enable the pressure in the buoyancy tubes
to become stabilized and the solid particles of C02 to evaporate. After this period
the buoyancy tubes should, if necessary, be topped up with air, and the liferaft
subjected to a pressure holding test over a period of not less than one hour during
which the pressure drop will not exceed 5 % of the working pressure
(reseat pressure relief valve).
2. NAP - TEST
Each liferaft should be subjected to the necessary additional pressure (NAP) test
at yearly intervals after the tenth year of the liferaft’s life unless earlier servicing is
deemed necessary as a result of visual inspection. After allowing sufficient time for
the liferaft to regain fabric tension at working pressure, the liferaft should be sub-
jected to a pressure holding test over a period of not less than one hour during
which the pressure drop will not exceed 5 % of the working pressure.
2.1 Procedure
2.1.1 Plug the relief valves.
2.1.2 Gradually raise the pressure of 2.0 times the working pressure = 0,500 bar.
The test pressure should be 0,500 bar because the maximum pressures
calculated in the below table are higher.

* maximum permissible pressure with factor of safety of 5
2.1.3 After 5 minutes, there should be no seam slippage, cracking, or other defects,
or significant pressure drop. If cracking in the buoyancy tubes is audible, the
liferaft should be condemned. If no cracking is heard, the pressure in all buoyancy
chambers should be reduced simultaneously by removing the plugs from the relief
valves.
