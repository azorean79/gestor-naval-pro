This review has allowed us to make several \nimprovements to the process which will reduce:\n•\tthe time required to pack a liferaft (with reduced labour costs)\n•\tthe waste sent to landfill during each service (with cost and environmental benefits)\nThis service bulletin tells service stations about new part numbers and how to order \nthem. It also contains information about new techniques for preparing items during \npacking.\nFor other servicing optimisation tasks, refer to the service bulletins that follow:\n•\t44/21\t Marine liferafts — Servicing : Servicing optimisation (painter line sachet)\n•\t45/21\t Marine liferafts — Servicing : Servicing optimisation (radar reflector)\n34/21\t (Survitec)\n35/21\t (DBC)\n37/21\t (Zodiac)\nPage 3 of 20\nDUNMURRY - BELFAST - NORTHERN IRELAND \nSERVICE BULLETIN\n43/21\nMarine Mk IV liferafts — Servicing\nServicing optimisation (gasket seal, pyro/bellows valises, canopy zips)\nVersion 3:\nOct/24\n\n2.\t\nEquipment affected\nProduct group\nService manual \nreference\nSurviva Mk IV Liferafts \nwith a drop height of 36 metres or less\nM 269-00 (Eng)\nM 269-00 (Fra)\nSurviva Mk IV Extended Service Liferafts \nwith a drop height of 36 metres or less\nM 271\n3.\t\nEmbodiment date\nFrom 1 October 2021:\n•\tyou must do Paragraph 6.D. at each scheduled liferaft service\n•\tyou must do Paragraphs 6.E. and 6.F. at next scheduled liferaft service\n•\tyou must do Paragraph 6.G. when necessary\nPage 4 of 20\nDUNMURRY - BELFAST - NORTHERN IRELAND \nSERVICE BULLETIN\n43/21\nMarine Mk IV liferafts — Servicing\nServicing optimisation (gasket seal, pyro/bellows valises, canopy zips)\nOct/24\nVersion 3:\n\n4.\t\nNecessary parts\nYou must purchase each part number from Survitec.\nIt is recommended that you keep these parts in stock at all times.\nPage 5 of 20\nDUNMURRY - BELFAST - NORTHERN IRELAND \nSERVICE BULLETIN\n43/21\nMarine Mk IV liferafts — Servicing\nServicing optimisation (gasket seal, pyro/bellows valises, canopy zips)\nVersion 3:\nOct/24\n\nA.\t\nGasket seal\nThe gasket seal must be replaced at each service. \nSurvitec has found that the current gasket seal might leave an adhesive residue \non the container which must be removed before a new gasket seal can be \ninstalled. \nThis is a time-consuming process.\nThe gasket seal has been revised; it now has an alternative adhesive which \nleaves no residue.

This is a time consuming process, \nmade more complicated by the multiple container/liferaft configurations that are \ncatered for. Additionally, ‘do-not-cut’ tape is wrapped around each container strap and \nis replaced every time a liferaft is serviced, generating significant single-use plastic \nwaste.\nSurvitec has introduced multi-label sheets whereby all labels required for a given \nliferaft container are included on one sheet. The multi-label sheets also feature \n‘do-not-cut’ labels which replace the ‘do-not-cut’ tape that is currently used.\nThis service bulletin tells you how to remove existing container labels from the \ncontainer and replace with the new container labels from the respective multi-label \nsheet.\nThere will be an introductory period during which individual labels may be purchased \nto balance stock levels, but once complete, new multi-label sheets must be \nimplemented. \nAs there are current and legacy products not yet covered by a multi-label sheet, part \nnumbers for existing labels will not be made obsolete at this time to enable purchase \nfor use on those products only.\nPage 3 of 54\nDUNMURRY - BELFAST - NORTHERN IRELAND \nSERVICE BULLETIN\n46/21\nMarine — Liferaft Container :\nIntroduction of multi-label sheets\nVersion 2:\nMar/23\n\n2.\t\nEquipment affected\nProduct group\nService manual \nreference\nFerryman\nM 177\nFerryman Open Reversible Liferaft\nM 310\nMeans of Rescue\nM 236\nSurviva Mk I Liferaft\nM 090\nSurviva Mk II Liferaft\nM 245\nSurviva Mk IIII Liferaft\nM 251\nSurviva Mk IV Annual Service Liferaft\nM 269-00 (Eng)\nM 269-02 (Fra)\nSurviva Mk IV Extended Service Liferaft\nM 271\nSpares servicing kits for ESR (Survitec brand only)\nN/A\nSpares servicing kits for Ferryman (RFD brand only)\nN/A\n3.\t\nEmbodiment date\nDo this service bulletin at the next scheduled service.\nPage 4 of 54\nDUNMURRY - BELFAST - NORTHERN IRELAND \nSERVICE BULLETIN\n46/21\nMarine — Liferaft Container :\nIntroduction of multi-label sheets\nVersion 2:\nMar/23\n\n4.\t\nNecessary parts\nItem\nDescription\nPart number\n1\nSurviva annual service liferaft, multi-label sheet \nfor throw-over and davit-launch containers. \t\nRefer to Figure 1.\n—\nRFD brand\n53795001\nSurvitec Zodiac brand\n53796001\nDSB brand\n53797001\nSurvitec brand\n53819001\n2\nMulti-label sheet for davit-launch containers. \t\nRefer to Figure 2.\n53801001\n3\nSurviva extended service liferaft, multi-label sheet \nfor throw-over and davit-launch containers. \t\nRefer to Figure 3.\n53800001\n4\nFerryman multi-label sheet for throw-over containers. \tRefer to Figure 4.\n53798001\n5\nMeans of Rescue multi-label sheet for containers. \t\nRefer to Figure 5.\n53799001\nThese parts are available for purchase from Survitec and are supplied in \npacks of fifty.
