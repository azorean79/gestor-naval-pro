1.1 GENERAL
1.1.1 This manual is intended for use by the people who will do the regular servicing work on the
equipment. They will normally be employees of the Manufacturer or of Service Stations
appointed by the Manufacturer.
1.1.2 The manual describes the procedures used to disassemble, inspect, repair and reassemble the
equipment. These procedures must be strictly obeyed.
1.1.3 Eurovinil is the Design Authority for the equipment. The company has invested much effort to
create the equipment and its servicing procedures, so that the equipment will be capable of
reliable use, regardless of climate, weather conditions or circumstances.
While comments intended to improve the efficiency of servicing procedures are always welcome,
you must not make any changes to the servicing procedures without the permission of Eurovinil.
Unauthorised changes may cause the equipment to malfunction. They may also void the
approval of the equipment.
1.1.4 This manual covers the Eurovinil ISO and Leisure family of liferafts.
1.1.5 Items included in the liferaft may be subject to approval by the administration of the country
where the liferaft is intended for use.
1.2 LIFERAFT MODELS AND CONSTRUCTION TECHNIQUE
1.2.1 EUROVINIL liferafts are constructed with high-tenacity polyester fabric coated with a specific
mixture on both sides. This material is weather-proof and resistant to hydrocarbons and to
temperature range. It is also rot-proof, it does not deteriorate with time and does not need any
maintenance apart from normal cleaning with fresh water and detergent. Liferaft buoyancy tubes
and floor are assembled by means of high frequency (HF) electronic welding.
WARNING: TALCUM POWDER, WHICH IS NORMALLY USED FOR GOOD PRESERVATION
OF RUBBER MATERIALS, SHOULD NOT BE USED BY ANY MEANS ON
EUROVINIL LIFERAFTS.
All liferafts EV have rectangular configuration.

3.4.8 CYLINDER LEAK TEST
WARNING: ALWAYS CHECK WEIGHT OF THE CHARGED CYLINDER BEFORE
INSTALLATION ON RAFT.
3.4.8.1 Method A. 15-day quarantine period
(a) Check the weight of the cylinder at regular intervals during the 15-day quarantine
period.
(b) After fifteen (15) days the weight must be the same as when it was first filled.
(c) If the weight has decreased, proceed as described on par. 3.4.5.
WARNING: A CHARGED CYLINDER SHOWING LOSS OF WEIGHT CANNOT BE USED IN
SERVICE.
(d) If weight is the same, the cylinder can be used in service.
3.4.8.2 Method B. Chemical leak test
(a) Before the gas cylinder is chemically leak tested, the mass of the gas in the cylinder
is to be recorded, ensuring that it is within the limits indicated (±55g). If there is
insufficient gas in the cylinder, and/or a leak is detected, check cylinder as described
in Par. 3.4.2.
(b) Lay the cylinder to be tested on its side, in a rack, so that the valve end is protruding.
Ensure the valve and shoulder of the cylinder are free from dust and other
contaminates by carefully wiping using a clean, dry cloth.

(c) Using the measuring cylinder provided in the test kit, transfer 25ml of the test
solution into a polythene bag. The initial colour of the test solution will be a dark pink
colour.
(d) Attach the open end of the bag over valve head and attach it to the cylinder body
using one or more elastic bands. Make sure there are no air gaps in the seal.
(e) The polythene bag shall then hang 20 cm off the valve end of the cylinder with the
test solution in one corner.
(f) Maintain the test for a period of not less than one hour. Remove the bag, (ends
closed), and gently shake the solution. Make the observation as detailed in Par.
3.4.7.3. Alternatively, the bag can be shaken while still hanging from the cylinder.
(g) A control sample is necessary, this is made by introducing 25ml of test solution into a
bag which is not fitted to a cylinder, but must be sealed at the open end, to exclude
contamination from the atmosphere. This bag must be placed on the rack in the
vicinity of the cylinders under test, and the above test method applied.
3.4.8.3 Observations
(a) CO2 leaking from the cylinder will cause the pink colour of the test solution to be lost
and the test solution will become clear.
(b) If no colour change is observed there is no leak of gas from the cylinder.
(c) The control sample shall not change colour during the test. If a colour change takes
place, this indicates that the atmosphere in the test area is contaminated with CO2
and tests carried out under this control sample are therefore invalidated.
(d) Tests shall be repeated after corrective action has been taken on the atmosphere,
i.e. area ventilated.

3.6 REPAIRS
3.6.1 GENERAL
Repairing means mending the damage by means of fabric patches. The patch fabric must be the same as
the fabric of the item to be repaired. There may also be repairs of items such as studs.
3.6.1.1 Glue. The glue to be used for repairing must be of the EV/C2 type.
WARNING: EV/C2 GLUE IS FLAMMABLE. KEEP AWAY FROM FLAME AND
UNCOVERED LAMPS (NOT PROTECTED BY LAMP-SHADE. USE
ONLY IN WELL VENTILATED AREAS. DO NOT SPRAY INTO YOUR
EYES. WASH YOUR HANDS THOROUGHLY AFTER USING IT.
3.6.1.2 Glue preparation. The glue has to be prepared each time in the required quantity, as after
activation through catalyst, the glue can last for three hours maximum.
The catalyst should be added to the glue in the quantity of 8% by measure of weight, and of
5% by measure of volume.
Once the two components have been mixed, shake well until you get an even colour.
It is important to get a complete blending to prevent the catalyst from separating as
suspension medium.
3.6.1.3 Environment conditions. EV/C2 glue must be used in environments featuring the following:
Temperature: between 12°C and 35°C;
Relative humidity: not greater than 70%.
WARNING: AS TEMPERATURE INCREASES, THE CATALYSIS PERIOD
BECOMES SHORTER, VICEVERSA WHEN TEMPERATURE
DECREASES THE CATALYSIS PERIOD BECOMES LONGER.
3.6.1.4 Surfaces preparation. The surfaces must be degreased with MEK. Cleaning and degreasing
should be thorough. The whole area for repairing should be cleaned and degreased as well
as the edges of the torn part.
3.6.1.5 Glue application. Apply the glue to the surfaces to be joined in thin and even layers. Proceed
as follows;
(a) Apply the glue with a brush.
(b) Wait 4-5 minutes.
(c) Apply the glue again.
(d) Wait 7-9 minutes.
(e) Join the surfaces smoothing them uniformly.
WARNING: THE GLUED PARTS SHOULD NOT BE SUBJECTED TO STRESS
BEFORE 48 HOURS

3.6.2 REPAIRING TORN AREAS
Three types of repairing may be carried out on inflatable parts:
1. Minor: the typical dimension of the tear goes from a hole to a 5 cm tear, that is to say 0 < x < 50 mm; an
example of minor repair is the patching of small holes or tears smaller than 50 mm.
2. Major: the typical dimension of a major tear does not go beyond 500 mm, that is to say 50 < x < 500 mm.
3. Critical: the typical dimension of a critical tear goes beyond 500 mm. In this case do not repair and send
the liferaft to the Manufacturer.
For straight tears the characterizing dimension is the length. For more complex tears, “L” or “Y” types, the
characterising dimension is the diameter of the circumference circumscribing the tear.
FIGURE 3.32
Patching
3.6.2.1 Repairing torn areas with patches
Patches should stretch for at least 40 mm beyond the perimeter of the damaged part. For instance, if the
hole is 40 mm, the patch should have a diameter of at least 120 mm; if a straight tear is 100 mm long, the
patch should be at least 180 x 80 mm. Complex tears should be treated as holes by taking the characterizing
dimension of the tear as diameter of the hole.
WARNING: THE SHAPE OF THE PATCHES SHOULD BE CIRCULAR OR
RECTANGULAR WITH ROUNDED CORNERS
3.6.2.1.1 Fitting the patches
Proceed as follows:
1- Cut a patch of suitable dimensions.
2- Prepare and clean the area to be repaired as described in 3.6.1.
3. SERVICING SERVICE MANUAL Page 3.54
Apr/21

=== PÁGINA 75 ===
LEISURE SYNTESY LIFERAFTS
EUROVINIL S.P.A. - GROSSETO - ITALY
3- Spread the glue as described in 3.6.1.
4- Place the patch making sure you remove all the air bubbles with a spatula. For major repairs use
an inner patch as well.
5- After at least 48 hours, test the repair by inflating the part and checking that there is not pressure
drop.
WARNING: THE REPAIRED AREA SHOULD NOT INCLUDE ANY WELD OF
THE INFLATABLE PART, AS GLUEING CAN NOT GUARANTEE
TIGHTNESS ON THE STEP FORMED BY THE WELD AND THE
BUTT STRAP.
If the tear is near a weld do not repair and send the liferaft to the Manufacturer.
3.6.2.1.2 Limitations to repairing
It is allowed to repair the inflatable parts with patches up to a percentual surface of 25% of the total surface
of the panel. In any case, for each buoyancy chamber, when the buoyancy chamber consists of several
panels (see buoyancy tubes of decagonal liferafts), there should not be more than fifteen patches.
As far as patches are concerned, the following limitations are given on the ratio between different
dimensions of the patches:
Maximum ratio between lenght of the patch and diameter of the panel = 25 %.
Maximum ratio between the area of the patch and the area of the panel = 12.5 %.
Maximum ratio between the lenght of the patch and the lenght of the panel = 50 %.
Maximum ratio between the peripherical length of the patch and the circumference of the panel =40 %.
Maximum ratio between the length and the depth of the patch = 3 %.
12.5% of the surface
25% of the circumference
Length/depth = 3
50% of the length
FIGURE 3.33
Patching limitations
3.6.3 OTHER REPAIRS
The other repairs that may be carried out without sending the liferaft to the Manufacturer are mainly repairs
required by the out-of-roundness of the holes of the seats for the inflation, relief and non-return valves, or
minor repairs of the VTR fiberglass containers.

In the first case, it is sufficient to glue to the panel a reinforcing circular rim having an inner diameter equal to
the hole original one and an outer diameter greater by about 80 mm than the inner one.
Only minor damages on the container, that is to say faults in the outer layer of the gelcoat, may be repaired.
Proceed as follows:
1- Scratch the damaged gelcoat.
2- Degrease and clean the area with acetone.
3- Fill up the damaged area with some stucco.
4- Once the stucco has solidified, abrade the area giving it the right shape; then polish the area and,
if necessary, apply a thin layer of gelcoat.
